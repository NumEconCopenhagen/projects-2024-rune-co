# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **TABLE OF JUSTICE, PREMIER LEAGUE 2022/2023**. We simulate the Premier League season 2022/2023 based on xG (Expected Goals) to find the 'fair' end-of-year table.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following dataset**:

1. DataProject_raw.xlsx (*fbref.com and football-data.co.uk*)

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``import pandas as pd``
``import numpy as np``
