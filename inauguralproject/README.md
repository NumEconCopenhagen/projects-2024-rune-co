# Inaugural project

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages. The program itself installs numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, and optimize from scipy. Additionally, we use the .py file ExchangeEconomy.py.
